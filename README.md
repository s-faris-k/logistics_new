Ruby on Rails Application - Setup Guide
=======================================

This is a Ruby on Rails web application. This README will guide you through setting up the project, running it locally, and understanding its dependencies and structure.

Requirements
------------
Before running the application, make sure the following software is installed on your machine:

Ruby
----
Ensure Ruby is installed:
$ ruby -v

Recommended version:
$ ruby 3.1.2

Rails
-----
Install Rails if not already installed:
$ gem install rails

Or let Bundler manage it via the Gemfile.

ImageMagick
-----------
Required for image processing (used by ActiveStorage):
$ sudo apt install imagemagick

MySQL
-----
The application uses MySQL for its database.

Project Setup
-------------
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

1. Clone the Repository
$ git clone <your-repository-url>
$ cd <your-project-directory>

2. Install Dependencies
$ bundle install

3. Configure Database
Update the database configuration in config/database.yml:

development:
  adapter: mysql2
  database: your_db_name
  username: your_username
  password: your_password
  host: localhost

4. Set Up the Database
$ rails db:create
$ rails db:migrate

If using ActiveStorage:
$ bin/rails active_storage:install
$ rails db:migrate

Running the Application
-----------------------
Start the Rails server:
$ rails s

Then visit http://localhost:3000

Running Tests
-------------
If you're using RSpec or Minitest, you can run tests like:

For RSpec:
$ bundle exec rspec

For Minitest:
$ rails test

Optional Services
-----------------
If used, configure or install the following:
- Redis – For caching or background jobs.
- Sidekiq – If using background job processing.
- ElasticSearch – For advanced search functionality.

Notes
-----
- This app uses ActiveStorage for file uploads.

- Use Rails credentials or environment variables for secrets.
- Deployment can be done via Heroku, Capistrano, or custom server setups.
